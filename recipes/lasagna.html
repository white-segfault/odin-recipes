    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
      <li> Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
        Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. </li>
      <li> Place squash, cut-side up, on the prepared baking sheet.
        Cover squash with aluminum foil. </li>
      <li> Bake in the preheated oven until squash is tender,
        45 minutes to 1 hour 15 minutes. </li>
      <li> Heat 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in a skillet over medium heat;
         cook and stir mushrooms and garlic in the hot oil until mushrooms
         are tender, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. </li>
      <li> Heat remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons olive oil in a separate skillet over
         medium heat; cook and stir onion in the hot oil until softened,
          about 5 minutes. Add spinach to onion; cook until spinach is
           heated through, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove skillet from heat. </li>
      <li> Heat 6 cups milk in a 5-quart saucepan over medium heat; cook and
         stir until milk is simmering, about 5 minutes. Whisk remaining 1 cup
          milk and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth; stir into
          simmering milk. Bring milk mixture to just under a boil, stirring
           constantly with a wooden spoon and scraping bottom of pot to prevent
            scorching, until milk mixture has thickened into a sauce,
            about 5 minutes; remove pot from heat. </li>
      <li> Whisk 1 1/2 cups Parmesan cheese, honey, nutmeg, sage, salt,
         and pepper into sauce until smooth. Cover pot with a lid and keep
          warm over low heat. </li>
      <li> Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
        Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally
        until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.</li>
      <li> Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
      <li> Scrape flesh from butternut squash into a bowl; stir with a
        fork until evenly mashed. Stir ginger, salt,
        and pepper into mashed butternut squash. </li>
      <li> Spoon about 1 cup white sauce into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish;
         arrange a layer of noodles atop white sauce. Layer 1/2 butternut squash
          mixture, 1/5 remaining white sauce, noodles, spinach mixture,
          1/5 white sauce, noodles, 1/2 the mozzarella cheese, mushroom mixture,
           1/5 white sauce, noodles, remaining 1/2 butternut squash mixture,
           1/5 the white sauce, remaining noodles, remaining 1/5 white sauce,
           remaining mozzarella cheese, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, respectively.
            Cover dish with aluminum foil and place dish on a baking sheet. </li>
      <li> Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Remove cover and bake
         until bubbling and cheese is browned, about 15 more minutes.
         Let stand for 10 minutes before serving. </li>
